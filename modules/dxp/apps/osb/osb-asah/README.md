# Asah

Asah is made up of small services that power Liferay Analytics Cloud. Each subproject in this repository represents one service.

Each customer is given unique instances of Asah's services. Those services are grouped under a workspace that is hosted by Liferay DXP Cloud.

For example, these services serve the data of an Analytics Cloud customer named ACME:

- `osbasahbackend-acme.liferay.cloud`
- `osbasahbatchcurator-acme.liferay.cloud`
- And so on...

As another example, these services serve the data of an Analytics Cloud customer named BOOBOO:

- `osbasahbackend-booboo.liferay.cloud`
- `osbasahbatchcurator-booboo.liferay.cloud`
- And so on...

## Services

### Diagram

<img src="./asah.drawio.svg">

### kong-gateway

This service proxies all requests directed to osb-asah-backend or osb-asah-publisher.

Please read [LRAC-15096](https://liferay.atlassian.net/browse/LRAC-15096) for configuration instructions.

### osb-asah-backend

This service exposes endpoints to the [Faro frontend](https://github.com/liferay/com-liferay-osb-faro-private) and Liferay Portal.

### osb-asah-batch-curator

This service processes raw data into intelligent information using scheduled routines (e.g., once a day).

### [osb-asah-performance-test](osb-asah-performance-test/README.markdown)

This service runs performance tests scenarios.

### [osb-asah-publisher](osb-asah-publisher/README.markdown)

This service receives events from HTTP requests made by users' browsers, and publishes them to [osb-asah-queue](#osb-asah-queue).

### osb-asah-redis

This is a Redis instance used as cache storage and message bus.

### osb-asah-stream-curator

This service processes raw data into intelligent information using routines with a higher frequency than [osb-asah-batch-curator](#osb-asah-batch-curator) (e.g., every 5 minutes).

### osb-asah-upgrade

This service defines upgrade steps that are executed on the deployment of new releases.

## Development Environment Instructions

Requirements:

- JDK 8+
- IntelliJ (recommended, CE is enough) or Eclipse
- Docker (on macOS or Windows increase memory to at least 4GB)
- Docker Compose

This repository should be imported by IntelliJ as a Gradle project. Once this is done, you can spin up a Docker container for Elasticsearch:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.integration-test.yml up -d`

To start a single service, for example `osb-asah-backend`, open its `*SpringBootApplication` class, right-click it and choose `Run 'Backend'`.

### Microservice

This is the default approach that starts a separate container for each service. This lets you modify and restart services individually without rebuilding everything.

This is also used for all paid customers to ensure there are sufficient resources to process all the data in a timely manner.

The downside to this approach is that it requires significantly more resources. At least 16 GB of memory is recommended.

To start up all services via docker, run `docker-compose up`.

### Environment Variables

When executing services with Docker Compose, you generally do not need to worry about environment variables because default values should be sane for local development.

However, if you choose to run services with IntelliJ or `gradle bootRun`, you will need to define the following variables, possibly with values different from the default ones:

- `LCP_ENGINE_ELASTICSEARCH_SERVER_IP`: Used to point to another Elasticsearch instance (default: `127.0.0.1`).
- `LCP_PROJECT_ID`: Used to set the project id which will determine the prefix in Elasticsearch indices (default `null`).
- `OSB_ASAH_PUBSUB_EMULATOR_URL`: Used to point to another Pub/Sub instance (default: `http://osbasahpubsubemulator:8095`).
- `OSB_ASAH_REDIS_URL`: Used to point to another Redis instance (default: `http://osbasahredis:6379`).
- `OSB_FARO_FRONTEND_URL`: Used to point to a Faro instance, please set it your local instance (default: `https://analytics.liferay.com`).
- `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`: Used set the active profile, 'default' profile is not allowed, use of the possible values: `dev`, `prod`, `test`.

The following is a nonexhaustive list, see `ServiceConstants.java` for more details.
